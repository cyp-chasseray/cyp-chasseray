Hi I'm Cyprien,

A passionate code and data enthusiast. I love learning new skills and getting things done. 

I am just out of a 3 months intensive coding and Data Science bootcamp at le Wagon. 

Currently refining my skills in Data Visualization and learning Django. 

Open to share ideas and discuss opportunities ü§ù

My main language is Python but I am happy to switch and learn if the project is right!
